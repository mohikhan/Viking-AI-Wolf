# AI Wolf Introduction

AI Wolf is a social and incomplete information game which models a conflict between an uninformed majority(Villagers) and informed minority(Werewolves). It is a communication
game that requires several AI technologies such as multi-agent coordination, intentional reading and understanding of the theory of mind. The game takes place in alternating
phases during day and night. In the daytime there is a discussion between all the players to eliminate the Werewolves in their society whereas in the night time the Werewolves attack the villagers to eliminate them through voting. The eliminated player cannot proceed forward in the game. There are different roles in the Townsfolk team(ex. Seer, BodyGuard etc) and Werewolves team(Werewolf, Possessed).The winning condition for the majority is to eliminate all the Werewolves whereas for the minority is to eliminate the villagers or be in equal numbers with them.
